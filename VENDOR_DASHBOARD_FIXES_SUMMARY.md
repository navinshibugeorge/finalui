# Vendor Dashboard Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Bid Winner Notification Not Showing
**Problem**: After bidding timer ends, vendors weren't getting "You won the bid" notification.

**Root Cause**: The code was looking for won jobs in `getActivePickupRequests()` which only returns 'pending' requests, but after winning, the status changes to 'assigned'.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `handleTimerExpired` function to directly query assigned requests from database
- Added proper bid winning check using Supabase query:
```typescript
const { data: assignedRequest, error: assignedError } = await supabase
  .from('pickup_requests')
  .select('*')
  .eq('request_id', requestId)
  .eq('assigned_vendor', vendorProfile?.vendor_id)
  .eq('status', 'assigned')
  .single()
```

### 2. "My Jobs" Tab Not Showing Assigned Jobs
**Problem**: The "My Jobs" tab was empty even when vendor had assigned jobs.

**Root Cause**: The `fetchMyJobs` function was using `getActivePickupRequests()` which only returns 'pending' requests, not 'assigned' ones.

**Solution**: 
- Completely rewrote `fetchMyJobs` function to directly query the database
- Separated assigned and completed jobs queries:
```typescript
// Get assigned jobs
const { data: assignedJobs, error: assignedError } = await supabase
  .from('pickup_requests')
  .select('*')
  .eq('assigned_vendor', vendorProfile?.vendor_id)
  .eq('status', 'assigned')

// Get completed jobs  
const { data: completedJobs, error: completedError } = await supabase
  .from('pickup_requests')
  .select('*')
  .eq('assigned_vendor', vendorProfile?.vendor_id)
  .eq('status', 'completed')
```

### 3. Hardcoded Company Details in UI
**Problem**: "My Jobs" section showed hardcoded "EcoPlast Industries" and "Industrial Area, Sector 18, Noida" instead of actual company details.

**Solution**: 
- Updated job display to use dynamic data from database:
```tsx
// Before (hardcoded)
<CardTitle>EcoPlast Industries - {job.waste_type} Pickup</CardTitle>
<CardDescription>Bin {job.bin_id} ‚Ä¢ Industrial Area, Sector 18, Noida</CardDescription>

// After (dynamic)
<CardTitle>{job.factory_name} - {job.waste_type} Pickup</CardTitle>
<CardDescription>{job.factory_address} ‚Ä¢ Winning Bid: ‚Çπ{job.total_amount}</CardDescription>
```

### 4. Missing Supabase Client
**Problem**: The vendor dashboard component didn't have access to Supabase client for direct database queries.

**Solution**: 
- Added Supabase client import and initialization
- Removed duplicate import to fix compilation error

## Files Modified

1. **Added Supabase client import and initialization**
2. **Fixed `handleTimerExpired` function** - Now properly checks for bid wins using direct database query
