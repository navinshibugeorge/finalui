# Database Schema Fixes Applied

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Column Name Mismatches
**Problem**: The code was trying to use database columns that don't exist:
- `vendors.company_name` (doesn't exist, should use `vendors.name`)
- `pickup_requests.assigned_at` (doesn't exist)
- `pickup_requests.assigned_vendor_id` (doesn't exist, should use `assigned_vendor`)
- `pickup_requests.winning_bid_amount` (doesn't exist, should use `total_amount`)

**Solution**: Updated all database queries and UI components to use the correct column names.

### 2. Files Modified

#### `/lib/pickup-request-service.ts`
- Fixed vendor query to remove `company_name` column
- Updated pickup request update to use `assigned_vendor` instead of `assigned_vendor_id`
- Updated to use `total_amount` instead of `winning_bid_amount`
- Removed non-existent `assigned_at` field
- Commented out vendor detail assignments since those columns don't exist in pickup_requests

#### `/components/dashboards/industry-dashboard.tsx`
- Updated all references from `winning_bid_amount` to `total_amount`

#### `/components/dashboards/vendor-dashboard.tsx`
- Updated all references from `winning_bid_amount` to `total_amount`

### 3. Current Database Schema (Confirmed Working)

#### Vendors Table Columns:
- `vendor_id`, `name`, `email`, `contact`, `address`, `service_radius`, `rating`, `total_pickups`, `is_active`, `created_at`, `collecting_waste_types`

#### Pickup Requests Table Columns:
- `request_id`, `user_type`, `citizen_id`, `factory_id`, `citizen_name`, `citizen_contact`, `citizen_address`, `factory_name`, `factory_contact`, `factory_address`, `waste_type`, `estimated_quantity`, `actual_quantity`, `description`, `preferred_date`, `preferred_time`, `status`, `assigned_vendor`, `estimated_price`, `total_amount`, `pickup_date`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `bidding_ends_at`, `bidding_duration_minutes`

### 4. Verification
- Created and ran test script `test-bid-winner-selection.js` which successfully:
  - Found bids for a request
  - Selected the highest bid
  - Updated the pickup request with the correct winner
  - Verified the update worked

### 5. Result
The bidding timer expiration now works correctly without the database errors:
- ✅ Vendor details fetch without `company_name` error
- ✅ Pickup request update without `assigned_at` error
- ✅ UI displays bid amounts using correct `total_amount` field
- ✅ Build completes successfully
